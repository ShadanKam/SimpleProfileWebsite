            <summary> Misery</summary>
            <p>	Author: Stephen King<br />
		Publisher: Addison Wisley<br />
		Year: 1978<br />
		Review:
                <h5>Misery is very well written. King does a great job of demanding his reader's attention and keeping them hooked. Misery is quite fast paced for a novel. King never bogs his readers down with unnecessary detail. Every word earned a place.</h5>

			Review:
                <h5>I was introduced to this legend in the late nineties and remember buying the entire series with my internship money and reading The Hobbit before The Lord of The Rings. It's magical world pulled me instantly and I have been it's ardent fan. A monster of a book that I have read multiple times.  I highly recommend this gem to anyone who loves a great saga.</h5>

                <h5>Twists and turns make this first story in the series resemble a junior John Grisham thriller in which loose ends are expertly tied and more threads become compellingly unraveled.</h5>
